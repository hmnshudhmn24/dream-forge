a mist-covered archipelago where floating cities harvest storms
a vast desert where ruins sing at night, inhabited by sand-people
a planet of bioluminescent jungles and slow-moving sky-whales
an iceball world with subterranean magma gardens and glass-harvesters
an industrial renaissance island ruled by guilds of tinkers and wind-sailors
