# 🌌 DREAMFORGE — Generative World Builder

DREAMFORGE converts short seed prompts into rich fictional universes (world names, geography, species, histories, factions, culture, and story hooks).
This repo contains a lightweight pipeline and a Streamlit UI to experiment locally.

See `examples/` for sample prompts and `notebooks/` for a demo notebook.
